<h1>This is my personal website</h1>
<h2>Designed to showcase my skills, projects, and relevant experience</h2>

I have a background in JavaScript, and I'm currently studying React.js, hoping to land a role somewhere soon.

This website has a collection of information about myself, my skills, as well as a showcase of my completed and ongoing projects.
It also has a collection of my Social Media Profiles, so you can follow my progress as I grow as a developer.
