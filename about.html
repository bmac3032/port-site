        <h3>
          As a freelance developer, I currently work with clients remotely to
          help solve problems. I am a problem solver first, developer second.

            Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
            outdoors. I currrently live on Lake Marion in Manning, SC. So I
            spend a good amount of time fishing & hunting. I also enjoy racing,
            and you can catch me in Darlington, SC each Memorial day weekend for
            the Southern 500 (NASCAR). When I'm not outdoors, I enjoy Video
            Games & Movies. I love classic thriller movies, and Alfred Hitchcock
            is my favorite filmmaker of all time. I also believe you should
            never stop learning, so I spend a large amount of my free time
            exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web
            development world.
